For the file nettle_languages.csv, the codes are as follows:
Area is in km2
Population is in thousands
Stations represents number of stations used to calculate MGS
Langs is the number of languages in the given country
MGS is the mean growing season in months
Std is the standard deviation of the growing season

The idea to use this dataset to model untidy data came from Joseph Casillas and his "untidydata" module.
I'm hosting it here because my students had issues (conceptually and technically) installing his packages, but it is a good example to use.

Note that as a fun exercise (aside from just tidying it up), Nettle 1998 mentions that he excluded countries where the standard deviation was greater than 2.
